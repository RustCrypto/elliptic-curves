Pure Rust implementation of the SM2 elliptic curve as defined in the Chinese
national standard [GM/T 0003-2012] as well as [ISO/IEC 14888].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## ⚠️ Security Warning

The elliptic curve arithmetic contained in this crate has never been
independently audited!

This crate has been designed with the goal of ensuring that secret-dependent
operations are performed in constant time (using the `subtle` crate and
constant-time formulas). However, it has not been thoroughly assessed to ensure
that generated assembly is constant time on common CPU architectures.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## About SM2

ShangMi 2 (SM2) is a Weierstrass curve specified in [GM/T 0003-2012]:
Cryptography Industry Standard of the People's Republic of China.

The SM2 cryptosystem is composed of three distinct algorithms:

- [x] **SM2DSA**: digital signature algorithm defined in [GBT.32918.2-2016], [ISO.IEC.14888-3] (SM2-2)
- [ ] **SM2KEP**: key exchange protocol defined in [GBT.32918.3-2016] (SM2-3)
- [x] **SM2PKE**: public key encryption algorithm defined in [GBT.32918.4-2016] (SM2-4)

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.81** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- All on-by-default features of this library are covered by SemVer
- MSRV is considered exempt from SemVer as noted above
