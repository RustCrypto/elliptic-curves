Pure Rust implementation of complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic
curves ([Renes-Costello-Batina 2015]). Generic over field elements and curve
equation coefficients.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

This crate provides a generic implementation of complete formulas for prime
order elliptic curves which are defined by the short [Weierstrass equation]:

```text
y² = x³ + ax + b
```

It's used to implement the following elliptic curves:

- [`p192`]: NIST P-192
- [`p224`]: NIST P-224
- [`p256`]: NIST P-256
- [`p384`]: NIST P-384
- [`p521`]: NIST P-521
- [`sm2`]: ShangMi 2

## ⚠️ Security Warning

The elliptic curve arithmetic contained in this crate has never been
independently audited!

This crate has been designed with the goal of ensuring that secret-dependent
operations are performed in constant time (using the `subtle` crate and
constant-time formulas). However, it has not been thoroughly assessed to ensure
that generated assembly is constant time on common CPU architectures.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
