[secp256k1] (a.k.a. K-256) elliptic curve library written in pure Rust with
support for [ECDSA] signing/verification/public-key recovery, Taproot
[Schnorr signatures] as defined in BIP340, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH),
and general-purpose secp256k1 elliptic curve group operations which can be used
to implement arbitrary group-based protocols.

Uses traits and base types from the [`elliptic-curve`] crate.

Optionally includes a secp256k1 [`arithmetic`] feature providing scalar and
point types (projective/affine) with support for constant-time scalar
multiplication. Additionally, implements traits from the [`group`] crate
which can be used to generically construct group-based protocols.

## Security Notes

This crate has been [audited by NCC Group], which found a high severity issue
in the ECDSA/secp256k1 implementation and another high severity issue in the
Schnorr/secp256k1 signature implementation, both of which have since been
corrected. We would like to thank [Entropy] for funding the audit.

This crate has been designed with the goal of ensuring that secret-dependent
secp256k1 operations are performed in constant time (using the `subtle` crate
and constant-time formulas). However, it is not suitable for use on processors
with a variable-time multiplication operation (e.g. short circuit on
multiply-by-zero / multiply-by-one, such as certain 32-bit PowerPC CPUs and
some non-ARM microcontrollers).

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Supported Algorithms

- [Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)][ECDH]: gated under the `ecdh` feature.
  Note that this is technically ephemeral secp256k1 Diffie-Hellman
  (a.k.a. ECDHE)
- [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA]: gated under the
  `ecdsa` feature. Support for ECDSA/secp256k1 signing and verification,
  applying [low-S normalization (BIP 0062)][BIP0062] as used in
  consensus-critical applications, and additionally supports secp256k1
  public-key recovery from ECDSA signatures (as used by e.g. Ethereum)
- Taproot [Schnorr signatures] (as defined in [BIP0340]): next-generation
  signature algorithm based on group operations enabling elegant higher-level
  constructions like multisignatures.

## About secp256k1 (K-256)

[secp256k1] is a Koblitz curve commonly used in cryptocurrency applications.
The "K-256" name follows NIST notation where P = prime fields,
B = binary fields, and K = Koblitz curves.

The curve is specified as `secp256k1` by Certicom's SECG in
"SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters":

<https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf>

secp256k1 is primarily notable for usage in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,
particularly in conjunction with the
[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA].
Owing to its wide deployment in these applications, secp256k1 is one of the
most popular and commonly used elliptic curves.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.73** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- All on-by-default features of this library are covered by SemVer
