[secp256k1] (a.k.a. K-256) elliptic curve library written in pure Rust with
support for [ECDSA] signing/verification (including Ethereum-style signatures
with public-key recovery), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and general
purpose arithmetic which can be used to implement arbitrary protocols.

Uses traits and base types from the [`elliptic-curve`] crate.

Optionally includes a secp256k1 [`arithmetic`] feature providing scalar and
point types (projective/affine) with support for constant-time scalar
multiplication. Additionally, implements traits from the [`group`] crate
which can be used to generically construct group-based protocols.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

The secp256k1 elliptic curve arithmetic contained in this crate has never been
independently audited!

This crate has been designed with the goal of ensuring that secret-dependent
secp256k1 operations are performed in constant time (using the `subtle` crate
and constant-time formulas). However, it has not been thoroughly assessed to
ensure that generated assembly is constant time on common CPU architectures.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Supported Algorithms

- [Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)][ECDH]: gated under the `ecdh` feature.
  Note that this is technically ephemeral secp256k1 Diffie-Hellman
  (a.k.a. ECDHE)
- [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA]: gated under the
  `ecdsa` feature. Support for ECDSA/secp256k1 signing and verification,
  applying [low-S normalization (BIP 0062)][BIP0062] as used in
  consensus-critical applications, and additionally supports secp256k1
  public-key recovery from ECDSA signatures (as used by e.g. Ethereum)

## About secp256k1 (K-256)

[secp256k1] is a Koblitz curve commonly used in cryptocurrency applications.
The "K-256" name follows NIST notation where P = prime fields,
B = binary fields, and K = Koblitz curves.

The curve is specified as `secp256k1` by Certicom's SECG in
"SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters":

<https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf>

secp256k1 is primarily notable for usage in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,
particularly in conjunction with the
[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA].
Owing to its wide deployment in these applications, secp256k1 is one of the
most popular and commonly used elliptic curves.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.51** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.
