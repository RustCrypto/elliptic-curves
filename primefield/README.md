Generic implementation of prime fields built on [`crypto-bigint`], along with macros for writing
field element newtypes including ones with arithmetic backed by [`fiat-crypto`].

## About

A *prime field* is a [finite field] of order ùëù, where ùëù is a prime number. Because ùëù is prime, every
non-zero element of the field has a modular inverse.

Prime fields are notable for their use in cryptography, particularly for their use as coordinates
(a.k.a. base field) and the scalar field of elliptic curve implementations.

The implementation provided by this crate is built on [`crypto_bigint::modular`], which provides
a generic implementation of modular arithmetic with a modulus fixed at compile-time.
